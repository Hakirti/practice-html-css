  The Lake Street Transfer station was a rapid transit station on the Chicago
  "L" that linked its Lake Street Elevated with the Logan Square branch of its
  Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad from 1913 to 1951. The Lake Street
  and Metropolitan were both constructed in the 1890s by different companies.
  The two companies owning the lines, along with two others, unified their
  operations in the early 1910s; as part of the merger, the Lake Street's owner
  had to close its nearby station on Wood Street and build a new one to form a
  transfer with the Metropolitan. This transfer station had a double-decked
  construction (depicted), with the Metropolitan's infrastructure crossing over
  the Lake Street. This arrangement.
